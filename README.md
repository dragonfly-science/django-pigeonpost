## The Kereru

The kereru or [New Zealand wood pigeon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Pigeon)
is a large fruit-eating forest pigeon, endemic to New Zealand. The population
declined considerably duing the 20th century, due to pressure form habitat
destruction and from introduced mammalian pests. While it is beautiful bird, it
is a clumsy, noisy flyer. As far as we know, it has not been used for carrying
either letters or email.
